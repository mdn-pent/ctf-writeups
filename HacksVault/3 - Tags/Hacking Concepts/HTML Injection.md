**HTML Injection** is an attack that is similar to [Cross-site Scripting (XSS)](./Cross-site%20Scripting%20(XSS).md). While in the XSS vulnerability the attacker can inject and execute [Javascript](../Programming%20Languages/Javascript.md) code, the HTML injection attack only allows the injection of certain HTML tags. When an application does not properly handle user supplied data, an attacker can supply valid [HTML](../Programming%20Languages/HTML.md) code, typically via a parameter value, and inject their own content into the page.
