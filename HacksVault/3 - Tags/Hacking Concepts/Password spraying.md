Is an attack technique where a small set of common passwords is tested across many accounts. Unlike brute-force attacks, password spraying avoids account lockouts by testing each account with only a few attempts, exploiting poor password practices common in many organisations. Password spraying is often effective because many organisations:

- Require frequent password changes, leading users to pick predictable patterns (for example, `Summer2025!`).
- Don't enforce their policies well.
- Reuse common passwords across multiple accounts.

Common password lists for spraying include:

- Seasonal passwords.
- Default passwords used by IT teams (`Password123`).
- Passwords leaked in data breaches, like `rockyou.txt`.
